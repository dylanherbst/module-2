        "PREFACE
        TO THE SECOND IMPRESSION
        The part of the Introduction dealing with the manuscripts has been re-written in the light of the new classification of Axel W. Ahlberg (Prolegomena in Sallustium, Göteborg,º 1911), which was followed by him in his Teubner text (Leipzig, 1919) and, except in some minor details, by B. Ornstein in the Budé Salluste (Paris, 1924); and the critical notes have been made to conform to that classification. Some changes have been made also in the section on the "pseudo-Sallustian" works, to which a good deal of attention has been devoted during the past decade. Finally, some errors have been corrected and a few additions made to the bibliography.

         p. viii PREFACE
        TO THE FIRST IMPRESSION
        In the absence of an entirely satisfactory text of Sallust, the translator has made his own. In some points of orthography, for example in the assimilation of prepositions, he has not followed the manuscripts, but has aimed rather at uniformity.
        
        A complete translation of Sallust was submitted, including all the fragments on the basis of Maurenbrecher's Histories, but the General Editors decided, partly from considerations of space and partly because of the slight interest of the shorter bits, that only the complete Orations and Letters should be printed. To these have been added the Pseudo-Sallustian works mentioned on p. xviii of the Introduction.
        
        In not a few instances, perhaps oftener than a more gifted translator would have found necessary, Sallust's sententious brevity has been sacrificed to clearness.
        
        John C. Rolfe.""
